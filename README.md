The following package provides an easy way for using
KeyPathwayMiner and visualize its results via R.

The user can decide whether he wants to call KeyPathwayMiner
on his computer (via standalone) or with the Web api. 

With the kpm_options object the arguments for the execution
of the program can be set and viewed.
Given a biological network and a set of case-control studies, KeyPathwayMiner
efficiently extracts all maximal connected sub-networks.
These sub-networks contain the genes that are mainly
dysregulated, e.g., differentially expressed, in most cases studied.
